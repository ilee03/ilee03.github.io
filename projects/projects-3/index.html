      <h3>This is the fourth recipe.</h3>

      <div class="textbox">
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <p>
          Step 1 <br>
          Make flax egg: Mix together ground flax/chia and soy milk. Set aside to gel.<br>
          Step 2 <br>
          Prepare bread dough & Knead: In a large bowl, mix together flour, sugar, salt, and instant yeast. Stir in milk
          and oil (if using) until combined, then turn out dough onto a lightly floured surface. Knead (with your hands
          or a stand mixer) until the dough comes together and becomes slightly elastic (about 5 minutes). <br>
          Step 3 <br>
          When ready, the dough should be smooth and just slightly sticky, but it shouldn't stick to your hands. (You
          can use the Windowpane Test to see if enough gluten has developed.)<br>
          Step 4 <br>
          Proof: Roll your dough into a ball and place in a large greased bowl. Place a tea towel or plastic wrap over
          the bowl and let the dough rest until doubled in size.<br>
          Step 5 <br>
          Prepare cookie dough: While your dough is rising, prepare your cookie dough. Cream together coconut oil and
          sugar, then beat in flax mixture until well combined.Check bread dough: My dough usually takes about 1 ½ – 2
          hours to proof on the kitchen counter. <br>
          Step 6 <br>
          Deflate, assemble, and create; repeat 2nd proof<br>
          Step 7 <br>
          Bake and Finish! <br>
